<p>An early proponent of the theory Elaine Morgan was a documentary writer and composed a series of books on the topic that helped to raise more awareness for it beginning in 1972. The Aquatic Ape Theory was first proposed by Max Westenhofer in 1942 then once again in 1960 through the independent research of Alister Hardy. She would write about the theory in her book The Descent of Women which would go on to become an international bestseller and really increase the prominence of the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis and she would go on to pen other books on the matter such as The Aquatic Ape 1982 The Scars of Evolution 1990 The Descent of the Child 1994 and The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis 1997. The Aquatic Ape was originally coined in 1967 by Desmond Morris in his book The Naked Ape to describe Alister Hardys contention that man was More Aquatic in the Past - note the word More.
