<p>The way the novel and film begin are different too. These two genres have been doggedly competing since the first book came out as a movie. In the book Lucy first enters the Wardrobe while they were exploring the house. John Grishams A Time to Kill is a powerful courtroom drama that examines the difference between social justice and moral justice in a small town in Mississippi. I had to kill sometime so decided to watch a movie based on a book by one of my favourite writers John Grisham. Pin On Movie Ads.</p>

<p>The book To Kill a Mockingbird was very different from the movie in many ways but at the same time they were the same. As with most of his books this one also revolves around a court case and proceedings. The movie version of Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird follows the book very well. The way the novel and film begin are different too. The film was a critical and commercial success making 152 million at the worldwide box office. Pin On Movies.</p>
