<p>A Walk to Remember is adapted in the film of the same name. A Walk to Remember people change themselves for the better. Each of us regardless of who we are will inevitably die one day and before that happens we will experience the death of others not only older than us but also more than likely very dear to us. The novel set in 19581959 in Beaufort North Carolina is a story of two teenagers who fall in love with each other despite the disparity of their personalities. Of course I could not describe all the emotions and on three pages most likely they would have together around the same story but it would have been full of approving in different words of praise forms so you do Im afraid would become boring after the second paragraph it would not be speaking of the page a crime simply to write for example.
