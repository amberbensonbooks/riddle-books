<p>LT is a Goodreads-like book organizing social platform. Usually I look for books with at least 50 reviews. A few people have asked me about getting free books so I thought I would share. Its hard for me to want to purchase books because Im so used to getting them for freeand sometimes autographed. In most cases I have to order several titles and units to qualify for deeper discounts say 10 titles 25 units to get 50 off and free shipping purchased with a no returns policy.
