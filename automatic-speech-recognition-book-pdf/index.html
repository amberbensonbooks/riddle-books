<h3 id="robust-automatic-speech-recognition">Robust Automatic Speech Recognition.</h3><p>Automatic speech recognition ASR is an independent machine-based process of decoding and transcribing oral speech. Early Automatic Speech Recognizers Early attempts to design systems for automatic speech recognition were mostly guided by the theory of acoustic-phonetics which describes the phonetic elements of speech the basic sounds of the language and tries to explain how they are acoustically realized in a spoken utterance. This book presents a very valuable vista of the state-of-art of Deep Learning focusing on speech recognition applications Robert Kozma Mathematical Reviews September 2017.
