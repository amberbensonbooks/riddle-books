<p>The emphasis of the book is the fulfillment of the Great Commission. The book of Acts was intended to be a sequel to a plurality of Gospels which Luke refers to as many Thus to read Acts for all its worth it is necessary to attend to the connections not only with Lukes Gospel but also with those other narratives that. Paul taps into that pride of citizenship in his epistle 127. He is the author of this Gospel and The Acts of the Apostles. Covers the first 30 to 35 years of the history of the church.
