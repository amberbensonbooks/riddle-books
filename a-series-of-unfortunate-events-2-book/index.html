<p>The Reptile Room Netflix Tie-in Edition Violet Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. In the first two books alone the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain itchy clothing a disastrous fire a plot to steal their fortune a lumpy bed a deadly serpent a large brass. The Reptile Room is the second book in the series and is much better than the Netflix series. It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children.
