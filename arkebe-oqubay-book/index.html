<p>Arkebe Oqubay Abstract This book presents the findings of original field research into the design practice and varied outcomes of industrial policy in three sectors in Ethiopia covering export-oriented and import-substitution industries. He served two former prime ministers Hailemariam Desalegn and the late Meles Zenawi. The book seeks to learn from the failures and successes in the three sectors all of them functioning under the umbrella of a single industrial strategy. The author thanks Christopher Cramer Peter Lawrence John Sender and Fantu Cheru for insightful and useful comments. Minister Oqubay will be presenting three of his latest books.
