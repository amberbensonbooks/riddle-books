<p>From the author of LIES. The books had already been discovered by a new generation of readers in the 1960s particularly hippies and the college crowd according to popular lore. The author is clearly a fan and was allowed into the inner sanctum during filming to see how things worked first-hand something most fans of the movies would have given their left arms to experience. Anything you can imagine tells the story of how these wonderful films came to be made and it is a fascinating tale. Buy Anything you can imagine by Ian Nathan ISBN. Pin On Book Reviews.</p>
