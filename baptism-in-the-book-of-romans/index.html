<p>3 paragraph-by-paragraph exegesis and exposition. Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father so we too might walk in newness of life. Baker Academic 1998 - Religion - 919 pages.</p>
<h3 id="and-peter-said-unto-them-repent-ye-and-be-baptized-every-one-of-you-in-the-name-of-jesus-christ-unto-the-remission-of-your-sins">And Peter said unto them Repent ye and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins.</h3><p>Romans 61-4 NIV It is always interesting to me that when some people hear the word baptism they immediately smell water. It is flawed to claim that baptism is necessary for salvation. Notice the baptism leads to death which is a far cry from the function of water baptism. But to all who received him who believed in his name he gave power to become children of God who were born not of blood or of the will of the flesh. Holland tries to redress the balance by insisting that the body of sin in Romans 66 should be understood corporately as humanity under the power of sin and the Devil. If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead you will be saved.</p>
