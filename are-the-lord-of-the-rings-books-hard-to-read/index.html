<p>The Lord of the Rings. The book is cool when things ACTUALLY HAPPEN however the descriptions are so damn boring and interrupt the damn story so damn much that I can feel my hand wanting to reach to my DS to relieve the boredom of reading such huge descriptions now if there was a glossary it would be good if he had just put them in the back of the book but by putting them right in the middle of things going on it. Ill be honest Im not much of a reader.</p>
