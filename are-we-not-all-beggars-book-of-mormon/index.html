<p>Do we not all depend upon the same Being even God for all the substance which we have for both food and raiment and for gold and for silver and for all the riches which we have of every kind. We are ALL BEGGARS in that ALL of us even righteous people like yourself are WHOLLY dependent on the Saviors mercy come judgement day. The instructor in my Book of Mormon class shared some of his thoughts with his students this week. Do we not all depend upon the same Being even God for all the substance which we have for both food and raiment and for gold and for silver. In an 1831 revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith the Lord said the poor would one day see the kingdom of God coming to deliver them in power and great glory 21 May we help fulfill that prophecy by coming in the power and glory of our membership in the true Church of Jesus Christ to do what we can to deliver any we can from the poverty that holds them captive and destroys so many of their dreams I pray in.

<p>We do not hide the fact that we do not believe the Book of Mormon is an ancient text. Are We Not All Beggars. And behold even at this time ye have been calling on His name and begging for a remission of your sins. Benjamin places Yahweh the source of the wealth above the wealthy who thereby become beggars before Yahweh. We all beg for Gods forgiveness. Pin On Inspirational Quotes.</p>
