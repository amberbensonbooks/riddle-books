<p><strong>Bag Of Bones Book Review</strong>, Reviewed in the United States on June 17 2019 Verified Purchase Im in the process of reading Bag of Bones for the second time. Overall this would be a solid 4 star book from any other author but I dont apologize for holding King to a higher standard when it comes to creating characters that feel whole.

Bag Of Bones To The Bone Movie Stephen King Movies Stephen King From pinterest.com</p>
<p>Bag of Bones was maybe the first horror novel of liberal guilt. Liseys Story succeeds where Bag of Bones its. Im really glad so far that I made the decision because there was so much that had been missed in the first reading.</p>
<h3 id="well-i-finally-found-a-stephen-king-book-that-i-didnt-enjoy">Well I finally found a Stephen King book that I didnt enjoy.</h3><p>It feels a lot at times like say Toni Morrisons fantastic Beloved. If theres anyone who can claim they can write like the Devil its King. I didnt care about the characters the antagonist wasnt even a villain and while there were supernatural elements they were super minor for 550 pages and. Goodness me it was just incredibly dull and difficult to engage with. It may have worked on paper but on screen its laughable. Typical Stephen King slow burner horror doesnt really hit until middle to end of book and opens with a tragedy.</p>
