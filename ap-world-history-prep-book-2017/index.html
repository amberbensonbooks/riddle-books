READ as many books as you like Personal use. After teaching AP World History for 7 years where 90 of my students pass this is the only test prep book I would buy for my students. Definitely the Best Test Prep book for AP World History. Many people have gotten 5s and 4s on this exam which covers anything from the life of Alexander the Great to the different World Wars up until major cities in Africa and while it can sometimes seem like too much information having the right books can make things a whole lot easier. Furthermore you wouldnt be able to explain examples in your essay in as much detail if youve only read a few paragraphs about major historical events.</p>
