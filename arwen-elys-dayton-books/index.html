<p>Her legacy as a Seeker is not noble but savage. Arwen has always desired to be a writer from as far back as she can remember. It carried a group of scientists to a small distant planet - a primitive place called Earth. When she was about 8 years old she wrote her first story a science fiction saga about a prince from another galaxy that for the love of his kidnapped sister had to come to Earth where she was held. Her legacy is an honor an ancient role passed down for generations. Traveler Seeker By Arwen Elys Dayton Paperback In 2021 Kami Garcia Marie Lu Legend Seeker.</p>
