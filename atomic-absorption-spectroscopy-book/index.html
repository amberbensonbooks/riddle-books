<p><strong>Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy Book</strong>, Atomic theory began with John Dalton Figure PageIndex6 in the 18 th century when he proposed the concept of atoms that all atoms of an element are identical and that atoms of different elements can combine to form molecules. Other topics include the behavior of certain elements in the absorption tube and progress in atomic absorption spectroscopy employing flame and graphite cuvette techniques. Principle of Atomic Absorption Emission Spectroscopy 151 ATOMIC EMISSION-THE FLAME TEST When a small amount of a solution of a metal ion is placed in the flame of a Bunsen burner the flame turns a color that is characteristic of the metal ion.</p>
