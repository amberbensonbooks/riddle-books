<p>Thomson was a photographer and this book contains his pictures some of which provided the basis for the engravings sometimes misidentified in Anna Leonowens books. The story tells of a widow Anna Leonowens from the UK who travelled to Siam in the early 1860s to work as an English teacher. These reminiscences published in two books The English Governess at the Siamese Court and TheRomance of the Harem were themselves highly fictionalized versions of just a few years. According to Mongkuts biographer Abbot Low Moffat her accounts of her life at the court were not only exaggerated but she also misrepresented the king as a cruel tyrant.
