<p>When Anna proposed an all-expenses-paid trip to Marrakech Rachel jumped at the chance. An anarchist seamstress leaves a bomb on a train but it fails to blow up. Not long after the Nazis came to power Eberhard Arnold sent a manifesto to Adolf Hitler. The latest novel from one of Mexicos finest experimental writers is a madcap metafictive romp that picks up a few decades after Tolstoys Anna Karenina leaves off. With familiar themes of young love betrayal and self-understanding this book falls seems to be written for a typical young adult audience. Pin On Bookish Shares.</p>
