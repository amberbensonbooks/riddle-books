<p>Books with Bad Printing I am an avid reader on self helpspiritualismreligion and I find that some of these old books published by obscure publishers have very bad printing. The books narrator Anodos enters Fairy Land through a mysterious old wooden secretary. Yet the Monads must have some qualities otherwise they would not even be existing things. FREE Delivery on orders over 10 for books or over 20 for other categories shipped by Amazon. The worst of these kinds are words printed over the edge into the spine where you have to bend.
