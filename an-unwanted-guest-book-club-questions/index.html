<p>An Unwanted Guest is Shari Lapenas third novel but I have to admit its probably my least favorite of her works. But An Unwanted Guest is most definitely her best novel yet. Sort of joking but not really. To say I hated was less than enthusiastic about The Couple Next Door would be putting it mildlycough Very mildly. I did not mention any of the guests names.
