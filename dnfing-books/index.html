<p>I can never find it in myself to just not finish a book. I needed a post that was more bookish related so here it is. Im not shy about not finishing books I dont like.</p>
<h3 id="dnfing-books-or-series">DNFing books or series.</h3><p>That isDNFing books. Even though this months example says otherwise I dont DNF books often. DNF or Did Not Finish was and it still is until some degree a big no-no for me. I have talked about my reasons for DNFing books back at the end of 2019 and Ive mentioned 12 books I have DNFed since Ive decided to stop reading books that just dont agree with me. For example you stop halfway through because you werent enjoying the book. I always find DNFing books to be challenging especially because of the work and effort that authors have put into writing their piece of work.</p>
