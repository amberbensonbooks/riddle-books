<p>At times there is certainly more character and plot building that does create a lull but as the story unfolds it only adds to the suspense and drama. Martin is the globally bestselling author of many fine novels including A Game of Thrones A Clash of Kings A Storm of Swords A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons which together make up the series A Song of Ice and Fire on which HBO based the worlds most-watched television series Game of Thrones. Having already purchased 4 out of the 7 A Song of Ice and Fire HBO-Inspired Editions books many moons ago this 1-7 box-set was around the same price as purchasing the remaining 3 so I went ahead and purchased this set having fell in love with the story so far. Martin and his Song of Ice and Fire that I love in spite of it all. The Song of Ice and Fire Series is probably the best epic of all times.
