<p>I know I usually dont apologise for things like this but people have been asking for this video r. Write down short questions and comments and avoid long sentences. To me this doesnt seem like an offense. Actively annotating while reading also helps you develop a deeper understanding of the text whether it is fiction or non-fiction. Up until then my reading skewed heavily to the physical format and as youve seen I have no qualms writing directly in my books. Pin On David Foster Wallace.</p>

<p>And being a lot less confused while reading books with multiple points of view. To make things easier only annotate the most important parts and quotes. Use color-coded Post-It notes Sticky notes allow you to write down small annotations within the book without writing on the page. When reading for a class or project its easy to just passively take in information and forget it when you put down the book. Write your notes like youre having a conversation with the story.
