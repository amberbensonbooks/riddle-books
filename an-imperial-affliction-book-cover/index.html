<p>The people you should be worried about include my tulip obsessed mother her mysterious lover The Dutch Tulip Man and my delusional hamster who thinks that running on that little wheel of his will. Its An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houton and its a fake book by a made-up author. An Imperial Affliction is about a girl named Anna who has a rare blood cancer. I cant make An Imperial Affliction real. Since the fake novel features the character Tulip Man were assuming thats a tulip in the window on the cover.
