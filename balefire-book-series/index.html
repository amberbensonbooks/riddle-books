<p>But when I decided to order the Balefire series some older young adult fiction by the same author as a one-book-reprint I had already upped my expectations by a chunky notch. The one thing about their relationship that was very different in this book as opposed to the other books in the series was the amount of time they spent together in bed. A Chalice of Wind. A pretty sweet deal. In high school I nostalgically went to that section in the library and while trying to decide which book in the Sweep series I should checkout for the millionth time I noticed the Balefire series.
