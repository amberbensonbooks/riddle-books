<p>Wish you well Wish You Well is a book that is superbly written by David Baldacci the basic story line revolves within the life of Louisa Mae Cardinal insecure girl aged twelve years surviving in the extreme life of New York City in the wake of 1940s with her much-admired but poorly paid father her loving mother and her younger brother. Although there is a lot of sinister action taking place just below the surface both figuratively and literally this is mainly a story of love and family. Add a book note. An automobile accident kills their father leaves their mother catatonic and yanks the children from their familiar big city life into the comparatively primitive environment of 1940 rural Virginia. My understanding is that Wish You Well is different from most of David Baldaccis books. Free Sample Piano Sheetmusic Christmas Sheet Music Sheet Music Christmas Music Printables.</p>
